The US scientists have unveiled a microchip, named KiloCore, containing 1,000 independent programmable processors. The chip has been designed by a team at the University of California, Davis, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The KiloCore was presented at the 2016 Symposium on the VLSI technology and circuits in Honolulu on June 16, 2016. The energy efficient chip has a maximum computation rate of 1.78 trillion instructions per second. It contains 621 million transistors. It has fabricated by IBM using their 32 nm CMOS technology. Each processor core can run its own small program independently of the others. The team said that the other multiple-processor chips that had been created till now never exceeded 300 processors. Cores operate at an average maximum clock frequency of 1.78 GHz. As each processor is independently clocked, it can shut itself down to further save energy when not needed. It can execute 115 billion instructions per second while dissipating only 0.7 Watts. Therefore, it is low enough to be powered by a single AA battery. The KiloCore chip executes instructions more than 100 times more efficiently than a modern laptop processor.<br/>
This is fundamentally more flexible approach than so called Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data approaches utilized by processors such as GPU’s. The idea is to break up an application into many small pieces, each of which can run in parallel on different processors, enabling high throughput with lower energy use.
